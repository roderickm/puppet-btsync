# == Class: btsync
#
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# === Variables
#
# [*sample_variable*]
#   Explanation of how this variable affects the funtion of this class and if it
#   has a default. e.g. "The parameter enc_ntp_servers must be set by the
#   External Node Classifier as a comma separated list of hostnames." (Note,
#   global variables should not be used in preference to class parameters  as of
#   Puppet 2.6.)
#
# === Examples
#
#  class { btsync:
#    servers => [ 'pool.ntp.org', 'ntp.local.company.com' ]
#  }
