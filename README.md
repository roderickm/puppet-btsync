About
------
This is module makes it easy to manage shared folders using the BitTorrent
SyncApp (btsync). Think Dropbox with a bitorrent backend and no server. (and no storage
fees) Kinda like an eventually consistent filesystem. 

Installation
------------

    puppet module install KyleAnderson/btsync

Then put your btsync binary in the `btsync/files/` directory based on the arch:

    cd modules/btsync/files
    ./download-btsyncs.sh

Examples
-------
Simple shared folder with defaults:

    class { 'btsync': }
    btsync::shared_folder { '/media/sync': secret => 'HIKVMVKXNORH33X......' }

A more complicated example, explicit settings, dropbox-like, random port:

    class { 'btsync': listening_port => 0, upload_limit => 50, download_limit => 500 }
    btsync::shared_folder { '/media/sync': 
      secret           => 'HIKVMVKXNORH33X......' }
      use_relay_server => true,
      use_tracker      => true,
      use_dht          => true,
      search_lan       => true,
      use_sync_trash   => true,
    }

Pro. Internal only with explicity node declaration running as www-data:

    class { 'btsync': user => 'www-data', use_upnp => false }
    btsync::shared_folder { '/var/www/': 
      secret           => 'HIKVMVKXNORH33X......' }
      use_relay_server => false,
      use_tracker      => false,
      use_dht          => false,
      search_lan       => true,
      use_sync_trash   => false,
      known_hosts      => [ "web1:6881", "web2:6881", "web3:6881" ],
    } 


Bugs
-------
*   In order to make valid json with puppet-concat, I have to add an empty trailing {} without a comma. btsync complains but works anyway
*   Only supporting upstart scripts for now
*   Would be nice to support multiple instances of btsync running for performance or security reasons. Maybe someday.
